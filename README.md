# 💡  Problem Statement

In the realm of peer-to-peer transactions, existing payment systems often fall short in providing a decentralized and user-friendly experience. Conventional platforms lack the innovative features required for effortless group expense management, instant cashback rewards, and efficient communication within the transaction ecosystem. Recognizing these limitations, ModePay was conceived to bridge these gaps, offering a decentralized payment solution on the Mode blockchain.

# 💪 Goals

- It allows users to make splits, directly pay friends, and manage transactions in a secure and efficient manner.
- The integration of Mode's SFS (Sequencer Fee Sharing) feature ensures that every transaction comes with a random cashback reward, providing users with an added incentive to use the platform.
- Leveraging the Push Protocol Chat feature, users can communicate in a decentralized way within the platform and settle group expenses seamlessly. 

# 🧠 Knowledge Primer

- [Mode](https://docs.mode.network/) is an Ethereum L2 built to encourage and support a cooperative on-chain experience. Users and builders grow as the network grows.
- [Push Protocol](https://push.org/) is a decentralized communication protocol for Web3! Using which any dApps, smart contracts, backends or protocols can send communication (starting with on-chain / off-chain / gasless notifs) tied to user wallet addresses in an open, gasless, multichain, and platform agnostic fashion.
