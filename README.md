# üí°  Problem Statement

Beneath Protocol addresses the insecurity of traditional email systems like Gmail and SMTP. By leveraging blockchain security, it offers a secure protocol, guarding against unauthorized access and impersonation. Beyond security, it enables cross-chain communication and ensures backward compatibility, facilitating seamless communication between web3 and web2 and vice versa. ‚ú®üî•

# üí™ Goals

- It allows users to make splits, directly pay friends, and manage transactions in a secure and efficient manner.
- The integration of Mode's SFS (Sequencer Fee Sharing) feature ensures that every transaction comes with a random cashback reward, providing users with an added incentive to use the platform.
- Leveraging the Push Protocol Chat feature, users can communicate in a decentralized way within the platform and settle group expenses seamlessly. 

# üß† Knowledge Primer

- [Mode](https://docs.mode.network/) is an Ethereum L2 built to encourage and support a cooperative on-chain experience. Users and builders grow as the network grows.
- [Push Protocol](https://push.org/) is a decentralized communication protocol for Web3! Using which any dApps, smart contracts, backends or protocols can send communication (starting with on-chain / off-chain / gasless notifs) tied to user wallet addresses in an open, gasless, multichain, and platform agnostic fashion.
